# Getting-Started-with-R
This repository is created by me to post the initial work of mine and small projects on R. This project has data set and code where one can learn and understand how to get started with linear regression models in R and a few work terminologies or concepts that are associated with it. and they are:
# Working Directory
# Import/Export Files
# Identifying Missing Values
# Assessing the Data ( Cleanliness, Missing Values, Normality Correction for ~lm)
# Understanding the Data ( Kurtosis Values, Skewness, Cooks Distance )
# Linear Modelling
# Step Wise Regression
# Dimensionality Reduction
